I grew up in Southern New Jersey in a house with my mother, father, younger sister, and multiple cats. I am a NCAA Division 3 soccer player at Juniata, and have played soccer almost my whole life. Some of my hobbies include golfing, playing video games, and spending time with friends and family.</p>

  <h4>Personal Statement</h4>
  <p>As a young man, I am looking forward to my future of becoming a successful individual and providing for my future family and children. I see myself becoming a successful individual because of my hunger to gain as much knowledge as I can, and be the best at what I am doing.</p>

  <h5>My POE</h5>
  <p>I am currently studying Accounting at Juniata College and plan on continuing to pursue this field of study.</p>

  <h6>Programming Interests</h6>
  <p>I am interested in learning more about HTML, and also learning Python and JavaScript.</p>

  <h6>Research Interests</h6>
  <p>I am currently interested in researching anything that sparks my interest at any given moment. I am always eager to learn new things and there is not much that I would not be interested in learning more about.</p>
