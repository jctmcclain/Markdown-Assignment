Markdown is tricky.  It will understand Markdown characters as well as HTML.
In either case, Markdown and HTML are text files.
The difference is the file extension:
Markdown -- .md or .markdown
HTML - .html or windows (.htm)

  <h6>Programming Interests</h6>
  <p>I am interested in learning more about HTML, and also learning Python and JavaScript.</p>
